Herlaar','LHerlaar.jpg','Nowadays computers are mostly used in networks where they have to cooperate with other computers. A computer usually also contains a collection of programs that have to work together. All in all, a modern computer network and computer system consists of a complex set of interlocking components and processes. Fortunately, we can make things clearer by introducing a good structure. In this course we study how computers are constructed and how the software uses them. You will also learn how computer networks such as the Internet are constructed. We look at the different protocols and you also learn to make calculations about, for example, the capacity of a network connection. Of course we also pay attention to wireless networks, telephone calls over the internet and security.'),

Concrete topics treated in this course include explicit management and synchronisation of threads, as well as higher level concurrency and parallelism abstractions. These ideas appear not only in Haskell, but in other modern languages such as C#, Scala, and Swift. An important part of the course is devoted to reasoning about the properties of concurrent programs. The language Haskell imposes a strong separation between pure computations, which are always safe to execute in parallel, and those with side-effects, which may result in non-deterministic behaviour when executed concurrently.'),

This information has to be kept, that is what database management systems are for. The differences with simple file systems are countless. For example, there are query languages to easily find information, transaction systems to allow many users to access and change the information at the same time, and schema information to know what the data actually means. This course deals with the basics of relational databases, with an emphasis on design and question languages. In addition, attention is paid to some recent developments, such as web databases and semistructured data and XML.'),
('Data structures','INFODS','Computer Science','BSc','BETA',4,'dr. G. Tel','GTel.jpg','Before one can write a computer program to solve a problem, an approach (a series of steps) must be devised that the program can follow to solve the problem. Such a series of steps is called an algorithm. This course discusses algorithms for sorting and searching a collection of data. Search algorithms play a special role because they depend on how the data is stored. A method of data storage is called a data structure. Various data structures are discussed in the lecture. For many problems, fundamentally different algorithms or data structures can be devised. In Data Structures you also learn how to estimate the runtime of algorithms (and the memory use of data structures) without the need for implementation. Some of the topics covered are: sorting (quicksort, heap sort, bucket sort, ...); hash tables; search trees; red-black-trees, ski lists, ... In addition, a number of topics from mathematics will be discussed. These are necessary for the analysis of the algorithms and data structures.'),
('Functional Programming','INFOFP','Computer Science','BSc','BETA',1,'dr. F. Staals','FStaals.jpg','In the course imperative programming you have become acquainted with the language C #. In that language, a program consists of assignments: do this, do that. In a functional language, a program consists of functions as you know them from mathematics. Writing programs in such a language requires a different way of thinking and that is exactly what we are going to talk about in this profession. In concrete terms, we are going to solve problems using the functional language Haskell. This language has extensive abstraction possibilities, which makes programs often very compact. You dont have to worry about many details, such as calculation order and memory allocation. The emphasis is on what and not how. Haskell also has an extensive typing system, of which more and more elements are also included in other languages. Functional language recursion is the equivalent of loop constructs (for, while) in C #. It is the way to write programs that walk across a data structure or do repeated calculations. Since functional programs have no variables that can change value during the processing of the program, it is easy to reason about such programs. We will show how to systematically derive and transform programs, and how to prove properties. We can use these properties to make statements about correctness or to rewrite programs. If the program contains recursive functions then the concept of induction is necessary during proofs.'),

You describe new types of objects yourself with associated methods, but you are also introduced to the standard methods associated with C #. Topics discussed include methods for creating interactive user interfaces, creating animations with a Thread, manipulating files, and managing collections of data (collections). In the lecture some larger programs are discussed as an example of applications: a graphic bitmap editor, a vector drawing program, a route finder. and automatic language recognition through letter frequency analysis. In addition, we immediately see why it is useful to organize object classes hierarchically, and how to put rows of objects in an array.

Different areas within computer science, such as databases, software systems, artificial intelligence, theoretical computer science, games and simulations, use logical tools, methods and techniques. For example, logical verification tools are used to analyze software systems and check for correctness.

From seemingly simple assumptions, he developed a method to predict the movement and rotation of objects based on the forces acting on objects. Mechanical energy, momentum, angular momentum and the associated conservation laws are important concepts that will be discussed. As the most spectacular application of Newtons laws and the previously mentioned conservation laws, we will learn to describe the orbits of planets around the sun. But we will also see for objects with very high speeds that the classical mechanics can no longer be correct. In that case, we must apply Einsteins theory of relativity, which makes the concept of relativity of motion even more important than Newton did. This theory has far-reaching consequences for our description of what space and time are. We will have to learn how to compare the measurements of lengths and durations of different observers, using the so-called Lorentz transformations. We will also have to adapt the concepts of energy and momentum to this new theory to describe collisions at very high speeds (such as in particle accelerators).'),

Statistical methods (mean, standard deviation, fluctuations, probability distributions) will play a central role in this.

Yet there are pitfalls and limitations that cant be overcome simply by increasing the amounts of data and computing power. For example, standard methods assume that the data are drawn from a single, unchanging probability distribution. The two main topics that we cover in this course both deal with situations where that is not the case. The first topic, causal inference, is the subfield of machine learning that studies causes and effects: if we make a change to one random variable in a system, for which other variables does the distribution change? An understanding of these cause-and-effect relations allows us to predict the results of a change in the environment. We will also look at the problem of learning these relations from data. Second, reinforcement learning is about the design of agents that can learn to interact with an unknown environment. Recent advances in supervised learning (such as deep learning) can be built on by reinforcement learning methods. This brings with it a unique set of challenges that we will cover in this course.'),
('Cognitive Modeling','INFOMCM','Artificial Intelegance','MSc','BETA',2,'dr. C.P. Janssen','CPJanssen.jpg','Formal models of human behavior and cognition that are implemented as computer simulations - cognitive models - play a crucial role in science and industry. In science, cognitive models formalize psychological theories. This formalization allows one to predict human behavior in novel settings and to tease apart the parameters that are essential for intelligent behavior. Cognitive models are used to study many domains, including learning, decision making, language use, multitasking, and perception and action. The models take many forms including dynamic equation models, neural networks, symbolic models, and Bayesian networks. In industry, cognitive models predict human behavior in intelligent user models. These user models are used for example for human-like game opponents and intelligent tutoring systems that adaptively change the difficulty of a game or training program to a model of the humans capacities. Similarly, user models are used in the design and evaluation of interfaces: what mistakes are humans likely to make in a task, what information might they overlook on an interface, and what are the best points to interrupt a user (e.g., with an e-mail alert) such that this interruption does not overload them? To be able to develop, implement, and evaluate cognitive models and user models, you first need to know which techniques and methods are available and what are appropriate (scientific or practical) questions to test with a model. Moreover, you need practical experience in implementing (components of) such models. In this course you will get an overview of various modeling techniques that are used world-wide and also by researchers in Utrecht (esp. in the department of psychology and the department of linguistics). You will learn their characteristics, strengths and weaknesses, and their theoretical and practical importance.

('Computational argumentation','INFOMCARG','Artificial Intelegance','MSc','BETA',3,'prof. dr. mr. H. Prakken','HPrakken.jpg','This course gives an introduction to the computational study of argumentation in AI, a currently popular subfield of symbolic AI. The course especially focuses on formal models of argumentation and their application in areas like commonsense reasoning, legal reasoning and multi-agent interaction. The computational study of argumentation concerns two aspects: reasoning and dialogue. Argumentation as a form of reasoning makes explicit the reasons for the conclusions that are drawn and how conflicts between reasons are resolved. Systems for argumentation-based inference were orginally developed in the field of nonmonotonic logic, which formalises qualitative reasoning with incomplete, uncertain or inconsistent information. Argument-based systems have been very successful as nonmonotonic logics, since they are based on very natural concepts, such as argument, counterargument, rebuttal and defeat. In this course the following formalism will be discussed: Default logic (a still influential early nonmonotonic logic) The theory of abstract argumentation frameworks (the generally accepted formal foundation of the field) The theory of structured argumentation frameworks, with a special focus on the ASPIC+ approach. Formal accounts of change operations on argumentation frameworks Formal models of legal case-based reasoning Argumentation as a form of dialogue concerns the rational resolution of conflicts of opinion by verbal means. Intelligent agents may disagree, for instance, about the pros and cons of alternative proposals, or about the factual basis of such proposals. Dialogue systems for argumentation formally define protocols for argumentation dialogues and thus enable a formal study of the dynamics of argumentative agent interaction, including issues of strategic choice. In this course two examples of such dialogeus systems will be discussed.'),

Nouwen','RWFNouwen.jpg','Both science and industry are interested in creating precise formal models of human behaviour and cognition. To help build, test and optimise such models, one needs to create and run experiments. Students participating in this course will learn (I) how to design experiments given an existing model, (II) how to implement experiments using various tools and, finally, (III) how to extract data from the recorded responses for analysis purposes. Most theoretical claims in linguistics and psychology are made by positing a formal model. The aim of such models is to make precise predictions. Moreover, the predictions of a model need to tested with formal experiments. The results of the experiment may or may not lead to changes in the model and thus lead to a new set of testable predictions. Essential in the modelling-experimenting cycle is careful experimental design. The course covers the practical and theoretical considerations for experimental research, from posing the research question to interpreting and reporting experimental results. In industry, experiments are also used frequently. For example, to assess how people use interfaces (e.g., where do they look or click, or how particular text influences their subsequent choices?), to test what the best design of a product is, or to test the appropriateness of a user model (e.g., do people learn what the model predicts them to learn, do they have a more immersive experience when a model guides adaptation of the software?). In this course you will get an overview of various experimenting techniques that are used world-wide and also by researchers in Utrecht (esp. in the department of psychology and the department of linguistics).

The aim of the course on proofs as programs is to get an understanding of type theory and its role within logic, linguistics, and computer science and get acquainted to the Curry-Howard correspondence, relating types to propositions and programs to proofs.'),

Moortgat','MJMoortgat.jpg','This course covers advanced methods and ideas in the logical analysis of language, with an emphasis on type-logical methods for the analysis of natural language syntax and semantics. The course has a capita selecta format, focusing on various aspects of the connection between language and reasoning. The 2019-2020 edition consists of three parts. In the first part, we introduce categorial grammar logics, starting with Lambeks Syntactic Calculus. We show how the syntactic calculus can be extended with control operations that allow for restricted forms of reordering and/or restructuring. We discuss the proofs-as-programs interpretation of syntactic derivations, comparing the set theoretic models of formal semantics with vector-based modelling as used in present day NLP. In the second part, we situate typelogical grammars in the wider context of substructural logics. The focus in this part is on prooftheoretic methods (display calculi, decidability) and on soundness/completeness with respect to algebraic and Kripke-style relational semantics. In the final part of the course, we introduce the machine learning perspective on the themes above. We show how from vector-based representations of word meanings one can compute the interpretation of larger phrases in a compositional way.');
